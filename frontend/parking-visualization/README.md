# DONE

Just a scratch for drawing the parking given an encoded grid/map.
<br>• Consider moving it to a js file.
<br>• Add nav bar
<br>• Add footer
<br>• Link to index.html and other pages

# TODO

<br> • Connect with the database.
<br> • Add listeners for updates in the database after talking about the connection with Nadine.
<br> • Draw the path to the closest free space - you should make direction checks for this (LRUP).
<br> • Entrance???? how are we doing this? do we remember in the database in which entrance the car comes in?
<br> • Change the pictures for the cars (Ben's is not cropped). Add rotated up and down cars - it is better for javascript, the rotation is hard, and make a sprite sheet.
<br> • Think about the style, CSS.
